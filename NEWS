Changelog for execline.

In 2.6.0.0
----------

 - The dollarat program now has its conflicting -0 and -d options
handled in the conventional way, with rightmost priority.
 - runblock now accepts a command line prefix, given as runblock's
own command line.
 - New binary: posix-umask.
 - cd renamed to execline-cd, umask renamed to execline-umask
 - With --enable-pedantic-posix, umask is a symbolic link to
posix-umask and cd is a symbolic link to posix-cd. Without this
option, umask is a symbolic link to execline-umask and cd is
a symbolic link to execline-cd.


In 2.5.3.0
----------

 - Bugfixes.
 - New configure option: --enable-pedantic-posix. This
makes the "cd" program a symbolic link to a "posix-cd" program
which is fully POSIX compliant. This makes distributions unable
to use the "execline breaks POSIX" pretext to refuse to package
execline correctly.
