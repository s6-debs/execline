execline - an interpreter-less scripting language
-------------------------------------------------

 execline is a scripting language unlike any other in that
it has no resident interpreter. It reads a script, turns it
into a single command line, and executes into that command
line; control is performed by executables run inside the
command line itself.

 It is especially suited to very small and simple scripts
for which a shell is overpowered.
