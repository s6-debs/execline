<h1> Variable substitution </h1>

<p>
 In a shell, when you write
</p>
<pre>
 $ A='foobar' ; echo $A
</pre>
<p>
 the <tt>echo</tt> command is given the argument <tt>foobar</tt>.
The <tt>foobar</tt> <em>value</em> has been substituted for the
<tt>A</tt> <em>variable</em>.
</p>
<p>
 Although <tt>execline</tt> maintains no state, and thus has no
real variables, it provides such a <em>substitution</em> facility
via <em>substitution commands</em>, namely:
</p>
<ul>
 <li> <a href="define.html">define</a> </li>
 <li> <a href="importas.html">importas</a> </li>
 <li> <a href="elglob.html">elglob</a> </li>
 <li> <a href="elgetpositionals.html">elgetpositionals</a> </li>
 <li> <a href="multidefine.html">multidefine</a> </li>
 <li> <a href="multisubstitute.html">multisubstitute</a> </li>
</ul>

<p>
 A substitution command takes a <em>key</em>, i.e. a string
(which can contain any character but <tt>$</tt>, <tt>{</tt> and
<tt>}</tt>, although it is recommended to use only alphanumerical
characters), and a way to compute a <em>value</em>.
</p>

<h2> Basics </h2>

<ul>
 <li> If the substitution key is <em>foo</em>, then the substitution
command will look for every occurrence of <tt>${<em>foo</em>}</tt> or
<tt>$<em>foo</em></tt> in the rest of its argv. Note that
<tt>${<em>foo</em>}bar</tt> matches, but <tt>$<em>foo</em>bar</tt>
<strong>does not</strong>. To be safe, always use the syntax with
braces, unless <tt>$<em>foo</em></tt> is a word on its own. </li>
 <li> Every match is then replaced with the <em>value</em>. </li>
</ul>

<p>
The simplest example is the following:
</p>

<pre>
#!/command/execlineb
define FOO blah
echo $FOO
</pre>

<p>
 which will replace the <tt>FOO</tt> key with the <tt>blah</tt> value,
then execute the <tt>echo</tt> command. So that script will print
<tt>blah</tt> on stdout.
</p>

<a name="quoting" />
<h2> Quoting </h2>

<p>
 execline allows you to write literal <tt>${<em>foo</em>}</tt> constructs
even when the <em>foo</em> variable is being substituted, thanks to a
quoting mechanism.
 Brace (pun intended) yourself: the following is the most complex part
of the whole language.
</p>

<h3> Rationale </h3>

<p>
 If we want to be able to have a literal <tt>${<em>foo</em>}</tt>, then:
</p>
<ul>
 <li> The <tt>${<em>foo</em>}</tt> sequence will mean one of two things:
be substituted, or <em>don't</em> be substituted. </li>
 <li> The default (unquoted) action should be: substitute. </li>
 <li> A sequence that means "do not substitute" should be able
to appear literally. The quote character should also be able to
appear literally before a sequence that means "substitute". (Tricky, eh?) </li>
 <li> There should be as few quote characters as possible, to avoid
shell-like quoting nightmares. </li>
</ul>

<h3> Syntax </h3>

<p>
 Rule:
</p>

<ul>
 <li> The backslash (<tt>\</tt>) is a quote character for substitution commands. </li>
 <li> The following rule applies only if the <em>foo</em> key is
explicitly used in a substitution command. If no command tries to
substitute anything for <em>foo</em>, sequences like
<tt>${<em>foo</em>}</tt> and preceding backslashes are left untouched. </li>
 <li> (Substitute.) If <tt>${<em>foo</em>}</tt> is preceded by <tt>2*n</tt> backslashes
(an <strong>even</strong> number), the whole sequence will be
replaced with <tt>n</tt> backslashes, followed by the substituted value. </li>
 <li> (Do not substitute.) If <tt>${<em>foo</em>}</tt> is preceded by <tt>2*n+1</tt> backslashes
(an <strong>odd</strong> number), the whole sequence will be replaced
with  <tt>n</tt> backslashes, followed by the literal <tt>${<em>foo</em>}</tt>. </li>
</ul>

<p>
 And now, the catch: the <a href="execlineb.html">execlineb</a> launcher,
as well as the shell,
interprets backslashes as escape characters. To make a word that contains
a backlash, you need to write <em>two</em> backslashes in your execline
script or shell command line. That means that the whole number of backslashes
you must write before your <tt>${<em>foo</em>}</tt> sequence must be doubled
for the substitution command to read the proper number of backslashes and
perform its work correctly. <br />
 Once you keep that in mind, the quoting rule is logical.
</p>

<h3> Example </h3>

<p>
 The quoting rule is best illustrated with the following example, where
the <tt>A</tt> key is substituted, and the <tt>$B</tt> sequences mean
nothing special.
</p>

<pre>
#!/command/execlineb
define A val
foreground { echo $A \\$A \\\\$A \\\\\\$A \\\\\\\\$A \\\\\\\\\\$A }
             echo $B \\$B \\\\$B \\\\\\$B \\\\\\\\$B \\\\\\\\\\$B
</pre>
<p>
 prints
</p>
<pre>
val $A \val \$A \\val \\$A
$B \$B \\$B \\\$B \\\\$B \\\\\$B
</pre>

<p>
 Phew.
</p>

<a name="el_transform">
<h2> Value transformations </h2>
</a>

<p>
 A value can go through
<a href="el_transform.html">several transformations</a> before it is
substituted. It can be <a href="el_transform.html#crunch">crunched</a>,
<a href="el_transform.html#chomp">chomped</a>, and/or
<a href="el_transform.html#split">split</a>.
</p>

<a name="split">
<h2> Substitution of split values </h2>
</a>

<p>
 A <a href="el_transform.html">split</a> value for <tt>FOO</tt> means that
a word containing <tt>${FOO}</tt> will be replaced by zero, one, or
(usually) more than one word. The value actually means a
<em>list</em> of values.
</p>

<p>
 The rule is: substituting a list of values
(<em>v1</em>, <em>v2</em>, <em>...</em>) for a key <em>A</em> is the
same as listing the substitutions of every value <em>v<tt>i</tt></em>
for <em>A</em>. <br />
 For instance,
</p>

<pre>
#!/command/execlineb
define -s FOO "v1 v2 v3" echo prefix-${FOO}-postfix
</pre>

<p>
 will substitute three values for <tt>$FOO</tt>: <tt>v1</tt>, <tt>v2</tt>
and <tt>v3</tt>. So the <tt>echo</tt> command will be called with three
arguments: <tt>prefix-v1-postfix</tt>, <tt>prefix-v2-postfix</tt>, and
<tt>prefix-v3-postfix</tt>.
</p>

<p>
(Implementation note: the fact that word prefixes are kept is
what makes execline's subtitutions secure.
<a href="el_semicolon.html">Blocks</a> are implemented via prefix
space characters; a substitution occurring inside a block will always produce
words beginning with the right amount of spaces, thus substituted
values cannot prematurely terminate a block.)
</p>

<a name="recursive" />
<h3> Recursive substitutions </h3>

<p>
 A direct consequence of that rule is that substitutions will be performed
recursively if more than one key appears in one word and the values for
those keys are split. Parallel substitutions are performed from left to
right. For instance, in
</p>

<pre>
#!/command/execlineb
define -s B "1 2 3" echo ${B}x${B}
</pre>
<p>
 the <tt>${B}x${B}</tt> word will be replaced with <em>nine</em> words:
<tt>1x1</tt>, <tt>1x2</tt>, <tt>1x3</tt>, <tt>2x1</tt>, <tt>2x2</tt>,
<tt>2x3</tt>, <tt>3x1</tt>, <tt>3x2</tt>, and <tt>3x3</tt>, in that order.
<br /> Here is an example with two distinct substitutions in parallel:
</p>

<pre>
#!/command/execlineb
multisubstitute
{
  define -s A "a b c d"
  define -s B "1 2 3"
}
echo ${A}x${B}
</pre>

<p>
 The <tt>${A}x${B}</tt> word will be replaced with <em>twelve</em> words:
<tt>ax1</tt>, <tt>ax2</tt>, <tt>ax3</tt>, <tt>bx1</tt>, <tt>bx2</tt>,
<tt>bx3</tt>, <tt>cx1</tt>, <tt>cx2</tt>, <tt>cx3</tt>, <tt>dx1</tt>,
<tt>dx2</tt>, and <tt>dx3</tt>, in that order. You can check that the
order of the <tt>define</tt> directives in
<a href="multisubstitute.html">multisubstitute</a> does not matter.
</p>

<p>
If the left-to-right order does not suit you, then you should perform
<em>serial</em> substitutions. For instance, the previous script can
be replaced with
</p>

<pre>
#!/command/execlineb
define -s B "1 2 3"
define -s A "a b c d"
echo ${A}x${B}
</pre>
<p>
 and will substitute <tt>${B}</tt> first, then <tt>${A}</tt>. So it
will print
</p>

<pre>
ax1 bx1 cx1 dx1 ax2 bx2 cx2 dx2 ax3 bx3 cx3 dx3
</pre>

<p>
 in that order.

<h2> Not for the faint of heart </h2>

<p>
 If you think you have mastered the art of execline substitution, then
you can try to do better than these people:
</p>

<ul>
 <li><a href="http://jriou.org/">Jo&euml;l Riou</a>
wrote the <a href="quine-jriou.txt">first execlineb quine</a>, using
only <tt>echo</tt> as non-execline external command. </li>
 <li> Shortly after, <a href="https://code.dogmap.org/">Paul Jarc</a>
wrote a <a href="quine-prj.txt">much shorter quine</a>, using
<tt>echo</tt> and <tt>env</tt> as non-execline external commands. He
also wrote a <a href="quine-prj-2.txt">revised version</a>, using only
<tt>echo</tt>, and a shorter <a href="quine-prj-3.txt">definitive
version</a>. The last one is probably very close to the shortest
possible execline quine. </li>
 <li> <a href="http://www.madore.org/~david/">David Madore</a>
wrote <a href="quine-dam.txt">another quine</a>, using <tt>printf</tt>.
His quine is longer than the other ones, but is well-commented and can
be used as a tutorial on how to write quines. :) </li>
</ul>
