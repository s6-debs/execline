<h1> The <tt>execline</tt> language design and grammar </h1>

<a name="principles" />
<h2> <tt>execline</tt> principles </h2>

<p>
 Here are some basic Unix facts:
</p>

<ul>
 <li> Unix programs are started with the <tt>execve()</tt>
system call, which takes 3 arguments: the command name (which
we won't discuss here because it's redundant in most cases),
the command line <em>argv</em>, which specifies the program name and its
arguments, and the environment <em>envp</em>. </li>
 <li> The <em>argv</em> structure makes it easy to read some
arguments at the beginning of <em>argv</em>, perform some action,
then <tt>execve()</tt> into the rest of <em>argv</em>. For
instance, the <tt>nice</tt> command works that way:
<pre> nice -10 echo blah </pre> will read <tt>nice</tt> and <tt>-10</tt>
from the argv, change the process' <em>nice</em> value, then exec into
the command <tt>echo blah</tt>. This is called
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chain_loading">chain loading</a>
by some people, and <a href="https://www.faqs.org/docs/artu/ch07s02.html">
Bernstein chaining</a> by others. </li>
 <li> The purpose of the environment is to preserve some state across
<tt>execve()</tt> calls. This state is usually small: most programs
keep their information in the filesystem. </li>
 <li> A <em>script</em> is basically a text file whose meaning is a
sequence of actions, i.e. calls to Unix programs, with some control
over the execution flow. You need a program to interpret your script.
Traditionally, this program is <tt>/bin/sh</tt>: scripts are written
in the <em>shell</em> language. </li>
 <li> The shell reads and interprets the script command after command.
That means it must preserve a state, and stay in memory while the
script is running. </li>
 <li> Standard shells have lots of built-in features and commands, so
they are big. Spawning (i.e. <tt>fork()</tt>ing then <tt>exec()</tt>ing)
a shell script takes time, because the shell program itself must be
initialized. For simple programs like <tt>nice -10 echo blah</tt>,
a shell is overpowered - we only need a way to make an <em>argv</em>
from the "<tt>nice -10 echo blah</tt>" string, and <tt>execve()</tt>
into that <em>argv</em>. </li>
 <li> Unix systems have a size limit for <em>argv</em>+<em>envp</em>,
but it is high. POSIX states that this limit must not be inferior to
4&nbsp;KB - and most simple scripts are smaller than that. Modern systems
have a much higher limit: for instance, it is 64&nbsp;KB on FreeBSD-4.6,
and 128&nbsp;KB on Linux. </li>
</ul>

<p>
 Knowing that, and wanting lightweight and efficient scripts, I
wondered: "Why should the interpreter stay in memory while the script
is executing&nbsp;? Why not parse the script once and for all, put
it all into one <em>argv</em>, and just execute into that <em>argv</em>,
relying on external commands (which will be called from within the
script) to control the execution flow&nbsp;?"
</p>

<p> <tt>execline</tt> was born. </p>

<ul>
 <li> <tt>execline</tt> is the first script language to rely
<em>entirely</em> on chain loading. An execline script is a
single <em>argv</em>, made of a chain of programs designed to
perform their action then <tt>exec()</tt> into the next one. </li>
 <li> The <a href="execlineb.html">execlineb</a> command is a
<em>launcher</em>: it reads and parses a text file, converting it
to an <em>argv</em>, then executes into that <em>argv</em>. It
does nothing more. </li>
 <li> Straightforward scripts like <tt>nice -10 echo blah</tt>
will be run just as they are, without the shell overhead.
Here is what the script could look like:
<pre>
#!/command/execlineb -P
nice -10
echo blah
</pre>
 </li>
 <li> More complex scripts will include calls to other <tt>execline</tt>
commands, which are meant to provide some control over the process state
and execution flow from inside an <em>argv</em>. </li>
</ul>

<a name="grammar" />
<h2> Grammar of an execline script </h2>

<p>
An execline script can be parsed as follows:
</p>

<pre>
 &lt;instruction&gt; = &lt;&gt; | external options &lt;arglist&gt; &lt;instruction&gt; | builtin options &lt;arglist&gt; &lt;blocklist&gt; &lt;instruction&gt;
 &lt;arglist&gt; = &lt;&gt; | arg &lt;arglist&gt;
 &lt;blocklist&gt; = &lt;&gt; | &lt;block&gt; &lt;blocklist&gt;
 &lt;block&gt; = { &lt;arglist&gt; } | { &lt;instrlist&gt; }
 &lt;instrlist&gt; = &lt;&gt; | &lt;instruction&gt; &lt;instrlist&gt;
</pre>

<p>
(This grammar is ambivalent, but much simpler to understand than the
non-ambivalent ones.)
</p>

<ul>
 <li> An execline script is valid if it reduces to an
<em>instruction</em>. </li>
 <li> The empty <em>instruction</em> is the same as the <tt>true</tt>
command: when an execline component must exec into the empty
instruction, it exits 0. </li>
 <li> Basically, every non-empty <em>instruction</em>, be it
"<em>builtin</em>" - an execline command - or "<em>external</em>"
- a program such as <tt>echo</tt> or <tt>cp</tt> - takes a number of
arguments, the <em>arglist</em>, then executes into a (possibly empty)
<em>instruction</em>. </li>
 <li> Some <em>builtin</em>s are special because they also take a
non-empty <em>blocklist</em> after their <em>arglist</em>. For instance,
the <a href="foreground.html">foreground</a> command takes an empty
<em>arglist</em> and one <em>block</em>: <pre>
 #!/command/execlineb -P
 foreground { sleep 1 } echo blah
</pre> is a valid <a href="execlineb.html">execlineb</a> script.
The <a href="foreground.html">foreground</a> command uses the
<tt>sleep&nbsp;1</tt> <em>block</em> then execs into the
remaining <tt>echo&nbsp;blah</tt> <em>instruction</em>. </li>
</ul>

<h2> execline features </h2>

<p>
 <tt>execline</tt> commands can perform some transformations on
their <em>argv</em>, to emulate some aspects of a shell. Here are
descriptions of these features:
